This is a readme which asks you to read it, but doesn't say anything other than asking you to read it again and again even when you are reading it. You can go on reading it as long as it asks you to read it and all that you'll get is a request to read it which you have been getting already since before you have even opened it for reading. So, by the time you read till here you must have realized that there is no point reading this which asked you to read it and you agreed to read it even though you were expecting something useful other than what you found here. If not, this is the time you should stop reading and realize that you are not here to read this and go back to whatever productive task you were doing. Anyway thanks for accepting the request reading :)
There is nothing wrong if you were tempted to read beyond the suggestion and found it actually interesting :P Thank you ;)
